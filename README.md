# AWS S3 Static Website Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to host a static website on AWS S3 using ACLs and static website hosting.  
The goal was to create a public website while learning key AWS concepts.

## Objective

- Upload website files (HTML + images)
- Enable static website hosting
- Make objects publicly accessible
- Test the website live

## Steps Taken
1. Created an S3 bucket with ACLs enabled and public access
2. Uploaded `index.html` and website images from the ZIP file
3. Enabled static website hosting
4. Made files public using ACLs
5. Tested the live website

## Key Concepts Learned

## Live Demo
The website was successfully hosted on AWS S3, but it has been deleted to avoid AWS charges.

## Time Taken
Approximately 1 hour

## Challenges and Rewards
The most challenging part was resolving the 403 Forbidden error caused by private files.  
The most rewarding part was seeing the website live on the internet, which made me happy because it demonstrated my skills in using AWS S3 and hosting a static website.
